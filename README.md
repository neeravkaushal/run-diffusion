Scripts for diffusion model of image data. Data used is MNIST images at path `data/mnist/train`. The model and parameters are basic so as to ensure a functional code and is prototyped from `https://github.com/explainingai-code/DDPM-Pytorch.git`.


Run model by `python3 train.py` at CLI after modifying parameters in `config.yaml` file.
